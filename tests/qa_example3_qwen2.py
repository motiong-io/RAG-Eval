        "Socialization in the context of organizational behavior refers to the process by which individuals learn the attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors necessary to function within a group or an organization.",
    "The stages of socialization in an organizational context include anticipatory socialization before joining, encountering organizational reality, and managing one's role to balance responsibilities and personal life, helping individuals align with organizational goals and culture.",
    "To be effective, mentors must execute career functions (like sponsorship, exposure, coaching, and developmental assignments) and psychosocial functions (such as role modeling, providing support, and counseling). By doing so, they promote mentees' professional growth and emotional well-being, aiding in career success.",
    "We are discussing the psychological contract because it plays a crucial role in organizational behavior, particularly in the socialization process. It refers to employees' beliefs about mutual obligations with their organization. Breaches, where employees feel promises are unmet, can lead to negative emotions and affect job satisfaction, commitment, and performance. Understanding psychological contracts is essential to grasp how expectations and beliefs about reciprocity influence employee behavior and attitudes, especially relevant for socializing newcomers and managing their expectations and obligations.",
    "Social Information Processing Theory suggests that individuals use information from others to interpret events and develop expectations about appropriate behaviors and attitudes. It works through information dependence, where individuals rely on others to understand how to think, feel, and act; interpretation of events, where information helps make sense of occurrences; and expectation formation, where individuals develop expectations about acceptable behaviors. This theory is crucial for understanding how organizational norms and expectations are transmitted and reinforced through social interactions, aligning with our learning goal of grasping social influence mechanisms in organizations.",
    "Examples of anticipatory socialization include formal processes like educational programs and recruitment events, as well as informal processes such as summer jobs and media portrayal. Understanding anticipatory socialization helps recognize how early experiences and perceptions shape individuals' approach to new roles, which is crucial for mastering organizational entry and employee adaptation processes.",
    "Divestiture Tactics are socialization methods used by organizations to strip away some of the new members' initial self-confidence and change their attitudes and beliefs. These tactics are designed to humble newcomers and correct faulty anticipatory socialization, making them more open to learning and adapting to organizational norms and culture. Examples include debasement or hazing, such as the rough treatment of U.S. Marine Corps recruits, and formal training programs that test commitment and resilience. Understanding divestiture tactics is crucial for recognizing how organizational socialization impacts newcomers' adaptation, aligning with the goal of mastering how different methods influence organizational behavior and employee integration.",
    "Institutionalized socialization tactics include collective tactics (e.g., military boot camps), formal tactics (e.g., orientation programs), sequential tactics (e.g., medical residencies), fixed tactics (e.g., internships with set milestones), serial tactics (e.g., mentoring rookie police officers), and investiture tactics (e.g., appreciating new hires' skills). Understanding these tactics is crucial for comprehending how organizations systematically integrate new members into their cultural and operational frameworks, aligning with the goal of mastering organizational behavior practices.",

Stages of Socialization 
• Anticipatory Socialization: A considerable amount of socialization occurs even before a person becomes a member of a particular organization. 
• Pre-Entry: The period immediately before entry into the organization. 
• Encounter: This stage immediately follows entry and involves the new member's initial experience with the organization.

• For mentors to be effective, they must perform two types of developmental functions: Career functions and Psychosocial functions.

• The career functions of mentoring provide career-enhancing benefits and include:
  - Sponsorship
  - Exposure and visibility
  - Coaching and feedback
  - Developmental assignments

• The psychosocial functions help develop the newcomer’s self-confidence, sense of identity, and ability to cope with emotional traumas that can damage a person’s effectiveness. They include:
  - Role modelling
  - Provide acceptance and confirmation
  - Counselling

When people join organizations, they have beliefs and expectations about what they will receive from the organization in return for what they will give the organization. Such beliefs form what is known as the psychological contract. A psychological contract refers to beliefs held by employees regarding the reciprocal obligations and promises between them and their organization. For example, an employee might expect to receive bonuses and promotions in return for hard work and loyalty. Unfortunately, psychological contract breach appears to be a common occurrence. Perceptions of psychological contract breach occur when an employee perceives that his or her organization has failed to fulfill one or more of its promises or obligations in the psychological contract. This often results in feelings of anger and betrayal and can have a negative effect on employees' work attitudes and behaviour. A review of research on the impact of psychological contract breach found that breach is related to affective reactions (higher feelings of contract violation and mistrust toward management), work attitudes (lower job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and higher turnover intentions), and work behaviours (lower organizational citizenship behaviour and job performance). These effects are due to the formation of negative emotions that stem from feelings of violation and mistrust toward management. Employee perceptions of psychological contract breach have also been found to be associated with a decrease in innovation-related behaviours (e.g., coming up with new ideas) and lower customer satisfaction, both of which can have negative consequences for organizations.

Research indicates that people entering organizations hold many expectations that are inaccurate and often unrealistically high. As a result, once they enter an organization they realize that their expectations are not being met and they experience what is known as a "reality shock."

• Social information processing theory: Information from others is used to interpret events and develop expectations about appropriate and acceptable attitudes and behaviours. 

• According to social information processing theory, organizational members use information from others to interpret events and develop expectations about appropriate and acceptable attitudes and behaviours. 

• Organizational members look to others for information and cues about how they should behave. 

• Individuals are often motivated to compare their own thoughts, feelings, and actions with those of others as a means of acquiring information about their adequacy. 

• The effects of social information can be very strong, often exerting as much or more influence over others as objective reality. 

• Individual behaviour is influenced and shaped by others.

• Divestiture tactics refer to what is also known as debasement and hazing. 

• This occurs when organizations put new members through a series of experiences that are designed to humble them and strip away some of their initial self-confidence and change their attitudes and beliefs. 

• Debasement is a way of testing the commitment of new members and correcting for faulty anticipatory socialization. 

• Having been humbled and stripped of preconceptions, members are then ready to learn the norms of the organization. 

• An extreme example is the rough treatment and shaved heads of U.S. Marine Corps recruits. 

• Sometimes organizations prefer not to use debasement or hazing as part of the socialization of newcomers.

• Formal: Segregating newcomers from regular organizational members and providing formal learning experiences during the socialization process.
• Sequential: Progressing newcomers through a series of discrete and identifiable stages towards their new role.
• Fixed: Providing a timetable for the assumption of the role (e.g., three months of training).
