By doing so, they promote mentees' professional growth and emotional well-being, aiding in career success.",
    "We are discussing the psychological contract because it plays a crucial role in organizational behavior, particularly in the socialization process. It refers to employees' beliefs about mutual obligations with their organization. Breaches, where employees feel promises are unmet, can lead to negative emotions and affect job satisfaction, commitment, and performance. Understanding psychological contracts is essential to grasp how expectations and beliefs about reciprocity influence employee behavior and attitudes, especially relevant for socializing newcomers and managing their expectations and obligations.",
    "Social Information Processing Theory suggests that individuals use information from others to interpret events and develop expectations about appropriate behaviors and attitudes. It works through information dependence, where individuals rely on others to understand how to think, feel, and act; interpretation of events, where information helps make sense of occurrences; and expectation formation, where individuals develop expectations about acceptable behaviors. This theory is crucial for understanding how organizational norms and expectations are transmitted and reinforced through social interactions, aligning with our learning goal of grasping social influence mechanisms in organizations.",

    "Divestiture Tactics are socialization methods used by organizations to strip away some of the new members' initial self-confidence and change their attitudes and beliefs. These tactics are designed to humble newcomers and correct faulty anticipatory socialization, making them more open to learning and adapting to organizational norms and culture. Examples include debasement or hazing, such as the rough treatment of U.S. Marine Corps recruits, and formal training programs that test commitment and resilience. Understanding divestiture tactics is crucial for recognizing how organizational socialization impacts newcomers' adaptation, aligning with the goal of mastering how different methods influence organizational behavior and employee integration.",
    "Institutionalized socialization tactics include collective tactics (e.g., military boot camps), formal tactics (e.g., orientation programs), sequential tactics (e.g., medical residencies), fixed tactics (e.g., internships with set milestones), serial tactics (e.g., mentoring rookie police officers), and investiture tactics (e.g., appreciating new hires' skills).

Socialization is the process through which individuals learn the attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors necessary to function effectively in a group or organization. It involves acquiring the necessary skills, knowledge, and values to fit into the organization's culture and expectations. This process includes learning about the organization's history, traditions, and values, as well as obtaining role-specific knowledge and developing necessary skills to perform tasks efficiently. Organizational socialization helps newcomers integrate into their new roles and engage with colleagues, ultimately reducing role ambiguity and conflict.

The stages of socialization are:

1. **Anticipatory Socialization (Pre-Entry):** This stage occurs before an individual joins the organization. It involves the expectations and knowledge that a potential member has about the organization and their role within it. It includes formal processes like education as well as informal experiences such as information gathered from media or previous jobs.

2. **Encounter (Organizational Member):** This stage begins when the individual actually joins the organization. It involves experiencing the reality of the organization and their role, which may differ from initial expectations. This stage includes orientation programs and initial interactions with colleagues and supervisors.

3. **Role Management (Organizational Member):** In this stage, the new member adjusts to their role, manages responsibilities, and integrates into the organizational culture. This involves balancing work roles with personal life and beginning to internalize the organization's norms and values.

These stages help new members transition smoothly into their roles and align their behaviors and attitudes with the organizational culture.

When people join organizations, they have beliefs and expectations about what they will receive from the organization in return for what they will give the organization. Such beliefs form what is known as the psychological contract. A psychological contract refers to beliefs held by employees regarding the reciprocal obligations and promises between them and their organization. For example, an employee might expect to receive bonuses and promotions in return for hard work and loyalty. Unfortunately, psychological contract breach appears to be a common occurrence. Perceptions of psychological contract breach occur when an employee perceives that his or her organization has failed to fulfill one or more of its promises or obligations in the psychological contract. This often results in feelings of anger and betrayal and can have a negative effect on employees' work attitudes and behaviour. A review of research on the impact of psychological contract breach found that breach is related to affective reactions (higher feelings of contract violation and mistrust toward management), work attitudes (lower job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and higher turnover intentions), and work behaviours (lower organizational citizenship behaviour and job performance). These effects are due to the formation of negative emotions that stem from feelings of violation and mistrust toward management. Employee perceptions of psychological contract breach have also been found to be associated with a decrease in innovation-related behaviours (e.g., coming up with new ideas) and lower customer satisfaction, both of which can have negative consequences for organizations.

Research indicates that people entering organizations hold many expectations that are inaccurate and often unrealistically high. As a result, once they enter an organization they realize that their expectations are not being met and they experience what is known as a "reality shock."

As newcomers learn about each of these areas, they should begin to master their tasks and integrate with others in their workgroup and the organization. This should also help to reduce their role ambiguity and role conflict. In Chapter 7, we described how different factors can lead to role ambiguity and role conflict. One of the goals of socialization is to provide new hires with information and knoY.iedge about their role to avoid problems of role conflict and role ambiguity. \n\nAn important objective of organizational socialization is for newcomers to achieve a good fit. There are generally two kinds of fit that are important for socialization. First, newcomers must acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to perform their work tasks and roles. This is known as person-job fit, or PJ fit. Person-job fit r.fers to the match between an employee's knowledge, skills, and abilities and the requirements of a job. Second, newcomers must also learn the values and beliefs that are important to the g roup and organization. This is known as person-organization fit, or PO fit, and it refers to the match between an employee's personal values and the values of an organization.• Research has found that both PJ and PO fit are strongly influenced by the socialization process and are related to job attitudes and behaviours.\" \nOne of the primary goals of organizational socialization is to ensure that new employees learn and understand the key beliefs, values, and assumptions of an organization's culture, and for individuals to define themselves in terms of the organization and what it is perceived to represent. This is known as organizational identification, and as shown in Exhibit 8.1, it is also a distal outcome of socialization. Organizational identification reflects an individual's learning and acceptance of an organization's culture.10 In summary, socialization is important because it has a direct effect on proximal socialization outcomes (e.g., learning, PJ fit, and PO fit), which lead to more positive distal outcomes \n(e.g., organizational identification). As we shall see, some of this process might occur before organization membership formally begins, while some of it occurs once the new member enters the organization. Furthermore, sociali zation is an o ngoing process by virtue of continuous interaction with others in the organization. However, socialization is most potent during certain periods of membership transition, such as when one is promoted or assigned to a new work group or department, and especially when one joins a new organization.11\n\n\n# Socia L Influence, Socialization, And Organizational Culture\n## Lo (D\nDescribe the main methods of socialization and how newcomers can be proactive in their socialization. \n\nOrganizations differ in the extent to which they socialize their new hires. This is in part ov.'ing to the fact that some organizations make use of other organizations to help socialize their members. For example, hospitals do not develop experienced cardiologists from scratch. \n\nRather, they depend on medical schools to socialize potential doctors in the basic role requirements of being a physician. Similarly, business firms rely on business schools to send them recruits who think and act in a business-like manner. In this way, a fair degree of anticipatory socialization may exist before a person joins an organization. On the other hand, organizations such as police forces, the military, and religious institutions are less likely to rely on external socialization. Police academies, boot camps, and seminaries are set up as extensions of these organizations to aid in socialization. \n\nOrganizations that handle their own socialization are especially interested in maintaining the continuity and stability of job behaviours over a period of time. Conversely, those that rely o n external agencies to perform anticipatory socialization are oriented toward maintaining the potential for creative, innovative behaviour o n the part of members-there is *less* \n\"inbreeding.\" Of course, reliance on external agents m ight present problems. The engineer who is socialized in university courses to respect design elegance might find it d ifficult to accept cost restrictions when he or she is employed by an engineering firm. For this reason, organizations that rely heavily on external socialization always supplement it with formal training and orientation or informal on-the-job training. \n\nThe point is that organizations differ in terms of *who* does the socializing, *how* it is done, and *how much* is done. Most organizations, however, make use of a number of methods of socialization, including realistic job previews, employee orientation programs, socialization tactics, and mentoring. Let's now take a closer look at each of these methods of organizational socialization.\n\n\n# Socialization Tactics\n- *Institutionalization* socialization tactics are effective in promoting organizational loyalty and uniformity of behaviour.\n\n- When socialization is *individualized*, new members are more likely to take on the particular characteristics and style of those who are socializing them.\n\n- Institutionalized socialization is always followed up by some individualized socialization as the member joins his or her regular work unit.\n\n\n# Methods Of Socialization\n- Organizations differ in terms of who does the socializing, how it is done, and *how much* is done. Most organizations make use of the following methods of socialization:\n- **Realistic job previews** - **Employee orientation programs** - **Socialization tactics** - Mentoring\n\n\n# Stages Of Socialization\n## - Anticipatory Socialization\n- Socialization that takes place before a person becomes a member of a particular organization.

So what \nhappens to new hires o nce the orientation program has ended? \nJohn Van Maanen and Edgar Schein developed a theory of socialization that helps us \nunderstand and explain the socialization process. They suggested that there are six socialization tactics that organizations can use to structure the early work experiences of new hires \nand individuals who are in transition from one role to another. As shown in Exhibit 8.4, \neach of the six tactics consists of a bipolar continuum that can be grouped into two separate \npatterns of socialization that are called institutionalized and individualized socialization \n(see Exhibit 8.5 for descriptions of each of the tactics).\"' \nINSTITUTIONALIZED INDIVIDUALIZED \nSOCIALIZATION SOCIALIZATION \nCollective CONTEXT TACTICS Individual \nFormal Informal \nSequential CONTENT TACTICS Random \nFixed Variable \nSerial SOCIAL TACTICS Disjunctive \nInvestiture Divestiture\nSocialization Steps in Strong Cultures\r\n– Step 1: Selecting Employees\r\n– Step 2: Debasement and Hazing\r\n– Step 3: Training “in the Trenches”\r\n– Step 4: Reward and Promotion\r\n– Step 5: Exposure to Core Culture\r\n– Step 6: Organizational Folklore\r\n– Step 7: Role Models\r\n• It is the consistency among these steps and their mutually reinforcing \nproperties that make for a strong culture.\nPerson-job fit r.fers to the match between an employee's \nknowledge, skills, and abilities and the requirements of a job. Second, newcomers must also \nlearn the values and beliefs that are important to the g roup and organization. This is known as \nperson-organization fit, or PO fit, and it refers to the match between an employee's personal \nvalues and the values of an organization.• Research has found that both PJ and PO fit are \nstrongly influenced by the socialization process and are related to job attitudes and behaviours.\" \nOne of the primary goals of organizational socialization is to ensure that new employees \nlearn and understand the key beliefs, values, and assumptions of an organization's culture, \nand for individuals to define themselves in terms of the organization and what it is perceived \nto represent. This is known as organizational identification, and as shown in Exhibit 8.1, it \nis also a distal outcome of socialization. Organizational identification reflects an individual's \nlearning and acceptance of an organization's culture.10 \nIn summary, socialization is important because it has a direct effect on proximal socialization outcomes (e.g., learning, PJ fit, and PO fit), which lead to more positive distal outcomes \n(e.g., organizational identification). As we shall see, some of this process might occur before \norganization membership formally begins, while some of it occurs once the new member \nenters the organization. Furthermore, sociali zation is an o ngoing process by virtue of continuous interaction with others in the organization. However, socialization is most potent during \ncertain periods of membership transition, such as when one is promoted or assigned to a new \nwork group or department, and especially when one joins a new organization.11 \nStages of Socialization \nSince organizational socialization is an ongoing process, it is useful to divide this process into \nthree stages. \n12 One of these stages occurs before entry, another immediately follows entry, and \nthe last occurs after one has been a member for some period of time. In a sense, the first two \nstages represent hurdles for achieving passage into the third stage (see Exhibit 8.2)."}

It also means that organizations must do more to provide mentoring o pportunities for minority employees, just as some have done for women. One organization that is doing this is IBM, where an Asian Task Fore,: identifies and develo ps talented Asian employees across North America who might benefit from mentoring. s7 RESEARCH EVIDENCE Many research studies have documented the importance of having a mentor when starting one's career and how it can influence career success.st A review of this research found that mentored individuals had higher objective career outcomes, such as compensation and number of promotions, and higher subjective outcomes, including greater satisfaction v.ith one's job and career and greater career commitment. They were also more likely to believe that they would advance in their career. However, mentoring tends to be more strongly related to the subjective than to the objective career outcomes. Furthermore, in comparisons of the effects of the two mentoring functions, the psychosocial function was found to be more strongly related to satisfaction with the mentoring relationship, while the career function was more strongly related to compensation and advancement. Both functions were found to be just as important in generating positive attitudes toward one's job and career.\n\n59 Research on formal mentoring programs has found that they are just as beneficial as informal mentoring relationships and are certainly more beneficial than not having mentors at all. In addition, formal mentoring programs have been found to be most effective when the mentor and protE:ge have input into the matching process and when they receive training prior to the mentoring relationship, especially training that is perceived to be of a high quality.\"' \nIn recent years, it has become apparent that many newcomers have more than a single mentor and that mentoring support can come from several people inside and outside of the organization, o r what is known as a developmental network. Developmental networks refer to groups of people who take an active interest in and actions toward advancing a protege's career by providing developmental assistance. Thus, unlike a traditional mentoring relationship that involves one prottgt and one mentor, in a develo pmental network a prott gt can have multiple develo pers from inside and outside (e.g., family and community) of the organi zation and include people from different hierarchical levels of the organization (e.g., \npeers, superiors, subordinates, and senior managers). With a developmental network, a newcomer is more likely to obtain different types of support (e.g., career and psychosocial) \nand a broader range of career outcomes.61 Developmental networks. Gtoups of people who take an active Interest In and actions toward advancing a prot~6's career by providing developmental assistance.\n## Employee Orientation Programs\n## Mentoring\nIt should be apparent from our discussion of socialization tactics that supervisors and peers play an important role in the socialization process. While effective relationships between supervisors and their employees do influence the socialization and career success of individuals v.ithin an organization, one particularly important relationship is between a newcomer or apprentice and a mentor. \n\nA mentor is an experienced or more senior person in the organization who gives a junior person (the apprentice or prott gt) guidance and special attention, such as giving advice and creating opportunities to assist him or her du.ring the early stages of his or her career. Vlhile someone other than the junior person's boss can serve as a mentor, often the supervisor is in a unique position to provide mentoring. \n\nMentor. An experienced o, more senior pe,son In the organization who gives a Junior person guidance and special attention. such as giving ad\\iice and creating opportunities to assist him or her during the early stages of his or her cateer. \n\nMentoring is a type of developmental relationship that produces benefits for a protfge's work and/or career . .w However, for mentors to be effective they must perform two types of developmental functions: career and psychosocial functions. \n\nCAREER FUNCTIONS OF MENTORING A mentor provides many career-enhancing benefits to an apprentice:\") These benefits are made possible by the senior person's experience, status, knowledge of how the organization works, and influence with powerful people in the organization. The career functions of mentoring include \n- *Sponsorship.* The mentor might nominate the apprentice for advantageous transfers and promotions. \n\no *Exposure and visibility.* The mentor might provide opportunities to work with key people and m, other parts of the organization. \n\n- *Coaching and feedback.* The mentor might suggest work strategies and identify strengths and weaknesses in the apprentice's performance. \n\n- *Developmental assignments.* The mentor can provide challenging work assignments that will help develop key skills and knowledge that are crucial to career progress. \n\nPSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONS OF MENTORING Besides helping directly with career progress, mentors can provide certain psychosocial functions that are helpful in developing the apprentice•s self-confidence, sense of identity, and ability to cope v.ith emotional traumas that can damage a person's effectiveness. These include \n- *Role modelling.* This provides a set of attitudes, values, and behaviours for the junior person to imitate. \n\n- *Providing acceptance and confirmation.* This provides encouragement and support and helps the apprentice gain self-confidence. \n\n- *Counselling.* This provides an opportunity to discuss personal concerns and anxieties concerning career prospects, work-family conflicts, and so on. \n\nMentoring relationships have often been of an informal nature. in that the individuals involved chose to enter into a mentoring relationship with each other without the direct involvement of their organization. However. formal mentoring programs. in which seasoned employees are recruited as mentors and matched with proteges as part of an organizationally sponsored program, have become increasingly popular in recent years and are now provided by many organizations.\" For example, Telvent Canada Ltd., a Calgary-based company that develops information management systems. started a formal mentoring program a number of years ago. Although it was originally offered to new hires to help get them up to spc-ed, it is now available to all of the company's employees. Bell Canada launched a companywide online mentor program several years ago called Mentor Match, which is open to all of its employees. The program is available on the company•s intranet. and employees must apply to be either a mentor or a protege.u WOMEN ANO MENTORING One factor that inhibits women's career development compared with that of their male counterparts is the difficulty women have historically faced in establishing an apprentice-mentor relationship with a senior person in the organization.0 The lack of mentors and role models is a major barrier for the career advancement of many women.44 The problem goes well beyond the traditional gender stereotyping we discussed in Chapter 3. \n\nIt stems from the fact that the senior people who are in the best position to be mentors are frequently men, and men are also more likely to serve as mentors than are women.4' Further. a young woman attempting to establish a productive relationship with a senior male associate faces complexities that the male apprentice does not. Often, a woman•s concerns are different from those her male mentor experienced at that stage in his career. As a result. the strategies formal mentoring programs. \n\nOtganlzatlona11y sponsored p(ograms In wtilch seasoned employees *are* \n,ecrulted as mentors and matched with prot~g~s. \n\n276 \n\n![6_image_0.png](http://storage.minio.middleware.dev.motiong.net/ta-ve-data/chatbot_testing_docs/img_736c6a6f4a402bac8e4d8a48dbc8c1b0/6_image_0.png)\nDescription for the above media: The image shows two people in a professional setting, likely an office. One person, who appears to be a woman, is seated and holding a folder or a stack of papers, possibly discussing or reviewing the contents. The other person, who appears to be a man, is standing and listening attentively. The background includes office furniture such as a desk and cabinets. The interaction suggests a work-related discussion or meeting.\n\nMany research efforts have documented the importance of having a mentor when starting one's career and how it can influence career success. \n\nthat he models might have limited relevance to the female apprentice. Perhaps the greatest difficulty is associated with fears that their relationship will be perceived as involving in timacy. \n\nConcerns about appearances and what others will say can make both people uncomfortable and get in the way of a productive relationship. \n\nBecause of these concerns, the prospective female apprentice faces more constraints than her male counterpart. Research has confirmed that cross-gender mentor-apprentice dyads are less likely to get involved in informal after-work social activities. These activities can help apprentices establish relationships with other influential people in a relaxed setting. \n\nResearch also confirms that apprentices in a cross-gender dyad are less likely to sec their mentor as a role model and, therefore, are less likely to realize the develo pmental benefits of an effective model.a+6 However, with many organizations now providing formal mentoring programs, the barriers facing women in finding a mentor have been removed. In fact, a recent review of gender differences in mentoring found that males and females are equally likely to have been a prottgt. And while male and female prottges report receiving equal amounts of career development mentoring, female proteges reported receiving more psychosocial support.47 Sim ilarly, a recent study on formal mentoring programs found that the negative effects associated with cross-gender dyads dissipates as the mentoring relationship develops over time. \n\nThus, prott gts in cross-gender dyads receive just as much career and psychosocial mentoring as those in same-gender relationships.\" \nHow critical is mentoring to a woman's career? The research evidence suggests that mentoring is even more critical to womt'tl's career success than it is to men's. \\>./omen who make it to executive positions invariably had a mentor along the way.

St Thus, for women with career aspirations, finding a mentor appears to be a d ifficult but crucial task. The good news is that an increasing number of organizations are developing mentoring and networking programs. For example, Deloitte has a program called Developing Leaders, in which experienced partners mentor and coach male and female partners who demonstrate leadership potential. Mentors are carefully chosen, and their skills and experience are matched to the new partner's goals and aspirations. In addition, women at Deloitte have developed networking and mentoring opportunities for themselves through a program calkd Women's Business Development Groups. The group organizes networking events and meets with other women's business groups and organizes an annual Spring Breakfast during which prominent women are invited to speak.si These kinds of networking opportunities are extremely important because research has found that exclusion from informal networks is one of the major roadblocks to the advancement of women.\n\n5\n\n)\n\n\n# Race, Ethnicity, And Mentoring\n## Mentoring: Research Evidence\n- Mentored individuals have higher objective (e.g., compensation) and subjective career outcomes (e.g., career satisfaction).\n\n- Mentoring is more strongly related to the subjective than the objective career outcomes.\n\n- The psychosocial function is more strongly related to satisfaction with the mentoring relationship.\n\n- The career function is more strongly related to compensation and advancement.\n- Formal mentoring programs are just as beneficial as informal relationships.\n\n- Formal mentoring programs are most effective when the mentor and protégé have input into the matching process and when they receive training prior to the mentoring relationship.\n\n\n# Psychosocial Functions Of Mentoring\n- The psychosocial functions help develop the newcomer's self-confidence, sense of identity, and ability to cope with emotional traumas that can damage a person's effectiveness.

# Socia L Influence, Socialization, And Organizational Culture
## Psychological Contract
When people join organizations, they have beliefs and expectations about what they will receive from the organization in return for what they will give the organization. Such beliefs fonn what is known as the psychological contract. A **psychological contract** refers to beliefs held by employees regarding the reciprocal obligations and promises between them and their organization. 16 For example, an employee might expect to receive bonuses and promotions in return for hard work and loyalty.

Unfortunately, ps)•chological contract breach appears to be a common occurrence.

Perceptions of psychological contract breach occur when an employee perceives that his or her organization has failed to fulfill one or more of its promises or obligations in the psychological contract. One study found that 55 percent of recent MBA graduates reported that some aspect of their psychological contract had been broken by their employer." This often results in feelings of anger and betrayal and can have a negative effect on employees' work attitudes and behaviour.

A review of research on the impact of psychological contract breach found that breach is related to affective reactions (higher feelings of contract violation and mistrust toward management), work attitudes (lower job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and higher turnover intentions), and work behaviours (lower organizational citizenship behaviour and job performance). These effects are due to the formation of negative emotions that stem from feelings of violation and mistrust toward management.16 Employee perceptions of psychological contract breach have also been found to be associated with a decrease in innovation-related behaviours (e .. g., coming up with new ideas) and lower customer satisfaction, both of which can have negative consequences for organizations.19 Psychological contract.

Psychological contract breach. Emplo~-ee perceptions that his o, her organization has failed to futfill one or more of Its ptomises or obligations In the psychological contract.

W hy does psychological contract breach occu r? As is the case with unrealistic expectations, recru.iters are often tempted to promise more than their organization can provide to attract the best job applicants. In addition, newcomers often lack sufficient information to form accurate perceptions concerning their psychological contract. As a result, there will be some incongruence or differences in understanding between an employee and the organization about promised obligations. In addition, organizational changes, such as downsizing and restructuring, can cause organizations to knowingly break promises made to an employee that they are either unable or unwilling to keep."
It is therefore important that newcomers develop accurate perceptions in the formation of a psychological contract. Man y of the terms of the psychological contract are established du ring an ticipatory socialization. Therefore, organizations need to ensure that truthful and accurate information about promises and obligations is communicated to new members before and after they join an organization. Incongruence and psychological contract breach are less likely in organizations where socialization is intense.i 1 Furthermore, there is some evidence that what o rganizations actually give employees is itself especially important.22 This further demonstrates the importance and need for organizational socialization. Let's now take a closer look at how organizations socialize new members.

How satisfying is this job of mine? How n ice is our boss? How much work should I take home to do over the weekend? Should we protest the bad design at the meeting? Objective, concrete answers to such questions might be hard to come by. Thus, we must often rely on information that others provide.\n\n2 In turn, this informa -\ntion dependence gives others the opportun ity to influence our thoughts, feelings, and actions via the signals they send to us.' \nT he process through which this occurs is explained by social information processing theory. According to social information processing theory, organizational members use in formation from others to interpret events and develo p expectations about appropriate and acceptable attitudes and behaviours. Thus, organizational members look to oth ers for information and cues about how they should behave.' Individuals are often motivated to compare their own th oughts, feelings, and actions with th ose of others as a means of acquiring information about their adequacy. The effects of social information can be ver y strong, often exerting as much or more influence over others as objective reality. As a result, individual behaviour is influenced and shap ed by others.' \nAs if group members were not busy en ough tuning in to information provide.cl by the group, they must also be sensitive to the rewards and punishments the group has at its disposal. Thus, individuals are dependent on the *effects* of their behaviour as determined by the rewards and punishments provided by oth ers. **Effect dependence** actually involves two complementary processes. First, the group frequently has a vested interest in how individual members think and act because such matters can affect the goal attainment of the group. \n\nSecond, the members frequently desire the approval of the group. In combination, th ese circumstances promote effect dependence. \n\nIn organizations, plenty of effects a re available to keep individual members \"under the influence.\" Managers typically have a fair array of rewards and punishments available, in cluding promotions, raises, and the assignment of more o r less favourable tasks. At the in formal level, the variety of such effects available to co-workers is staggering. They might reward cooperative behaviour with praise, friendship, and a helping hand on the job.

Thus, it should not surprise you that these forms of learning are also important for socialization. That is, newcomers can be proactive in their socialization and in the management of their careers through the use of proactive behaviours. \n\nProactive socialization refers to the process in which newcomers play an active role in their socialization th rough th e use of a number of proactive behaviours. Exhibit 8.6 describes the major types of proactive socialization behaviours. Two of the most importan t proactive behaviours are to request fmlback about one's work and job performance (feedback seeking) and to seek in formation about one's work tasks, roles, work group, and organization (information seekin g). Recall th at organizational socialization is about learning the attitudes, kn oY.i edge, and behaviours th at are necessary to function as an effective member of a group and organization. \n\nOne way for new employees to learn is to seek in formation from others in the organization.6l Newcomers can acquire information by requesting it, by asking questions, and by observing the behaviour of others. In addition, there are d ifferent sources that can be used to acquire information, such as supervisors, co-workers, mentors, and v.'Titten documents. However, research has found that newcomers rely primarily on observation, followed by interpersonal sources (i.e., supervisors and co-workers). Furthermore, they tend to seek out task-related in formation th e most, especially during the early period of socialization, followed by role, group, and organization information.\n\n6\n\n) \n\nIn addition to feedback seeking and in formation seeking, newcomers can also be proactive by participating in social events (general socializ ing), develo ping friendships and rela· \ntionships with co-workers (relationship building), developing a friendship and relationship with one's boss (boss-relationship building), getting to know p eople outside of one's depart· mentor work area {networking), and attempting to chan ge or modify o ne's tasks to improve PJ fit (job change negotiation).\" \nRESEARCH EVIDENCE Research has found that newcomers who engage in proactive behaviours more frequently are more likely to obtain the corresponding proactive outcomes. \n\nFor example, newcomers who frequently seek fec'<lback are more likely to obtain it and those who engage in relationship building are more likely to have developed friendships with co-workers. As a result, newcomers who are more proactive obtain more feedback and information, and develop more friendships and relationships, which results in more positive proximal and distal socialization outcomes.

This should also help to reduce their role ambiguity and role conflict. In Chapter 7, we described how different factors can lead to role ambiguity and role conflict. One of the goals of socialization is to provide new hires with information and knoY.iedge about their role to avoid problems of role conflict and role ambiguity. \n\nAn important objective of organizational socialization is for newcomers to achieve a good fit. There are generally two kinds of fit that are important for socialization. First, newcomers must acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to perform their work tasks and roles.

Second, newcomers must also learn the values and beliefs that are important to the g roup and organization.

This is known as organizational identification, and as shown in Exhibit 8.1, it is also a distal outcome of socialization. Organizational identification reflects an individual's learning and acceptance of an organization's culture.10 In summary, socialization is important because it has a direct effect on proximal socialization outcomes (e.g., learning, PJ fit, and PO fit), which lead to more positive distal outcomes \n(e.g., organizational identification). As we shall see, some of this process might occur before organization membership formally begins, while some of it occurs once the new member enters the organization.}

This is in part ov.'ing to the fact that some organizations make use of other organizations to help socialize their members. For example, hospitals do not develop experienced cardiologists from scratch. \n\nRather, they depend on medical schools to socialize potential doctors in the basic role requirements of being a physician. Similarly, business firms rely on business schools to send them recruits who think and act in a business-like manner. In this way, a fair degree of anticipatory socialization may exist before a person joins an organization. On the other hand, organizations such as police forces, the military, and religious institutions are less likely to rely on external socialization. Police academies, boot camps, and seminaries are set up as extensions of these organizations to aid in socialization. \n\nOrganizations that handle their own socialization are especially interested in maintaining the continuity and stability of job behaviours over a period of time. Conversely, those that rely o n external agencies to perform anticipatory socialization are oriented toward maintaining the potential for creative, innovative behaviour o n the part of members-there is *less* \n\"inbreeding.\" Of course, reliance on external agents m ight present problems. The engineer who is socialized in university courses to respect design elegance might find it d ifficult to accept cost restrictions when he or she is employed by an engineering firm. For this reason, organizations that rely heavily on external socialization always supplement it with formal training and orientation or informal on-the-job training. \n\nThe point is that organizations differ in terms of *who* does the socializing, *how* it is done, and *how much* is done. Most organizations, however, make use of a number of methods of socialization, including realistic job previews, employee orientation programs, socialization tactics, and mentoring. Let's now take a closer look at each of these methods of organizational socialization.\n\n\n# Socia L Influence, Socialization, And Organizational Culture\n## Unrealistic Expectations\nResearch indicates that people entering organizations hold many expectations that are inaccurate and often unrealistically high. As a result, once they enter an organization they realize that their expectations are not being met and they experience what is known as a '(reality shock.\"\" In one study of telephone operators, for example, researchers obtained people's expectations about the nature of the job *before* they started work. They also looked at these employees' perceptions of the actual job shortly *after* they started work. The results indicated that many perceptions were less favourable than expectations. A similar result occurred for students entering an MBA program. The extent to which newcomers' expectations are met ( or unmet) \nhas important implications for their socialization. Research has found that newcomers who have higher mt.'1: expectations have higher job satisfaction, organizational commitment, job performance, and job survival and lower intentions to leave.\n\n14 Why do new members often have unrealistic expectations about the organizations they join?n To some extent, occupational stereotypes, such as those we discussed in Chapter 3, could be responsible. The media often communicate such stereotypes. For example, a person entering nursing training might have gaint.-d some expectations about hospital life from watching the television show *Grey's Anatomy.* Those of us who teach might also be guilty of communicating stereotypes. After four years of study, the new management trainee at IBM \nmight be dismayed to find that the emphasis is on *trainee* rather than *management!* Finally, unrealistic expectations may also stem from overzealous recruiters who paint rosy pictures to attract job candidates to the organization. Taken together, these factors demonstrate the need for socialization and for helping recruits acquire more realistic expectations.\n\n\n# Socia L Influence, Socialization, And Organizational Culture\n## Stages Of Socialization\nSince organizational socialization is an ongoing process, it is useful to divide this process into three stages. \n\n12 One of these stages occurs before entry, another immediately follows entry, and the last occurs after one has been a member for some period of time. In a sense, the first two stages represent hurdles for achieving passage into the third stage (see Exhibit 8.2). \n\n![5_image_0.png](http://storage.minio.middleware.dev.motiong.net/ta-ve-data/chatbot_testing_docs/img_b322c069e96e0d11040aace0ffb8f138/5_image_0.png)\nDescription for the above media: The diagram illustrates the stages of organizational socialization. It is divided into three main phases:\n\n1. **Anticipatory Socialization (Pre-Entry)**\n - This phase occurs before an individual joins the organization. It involves the expectations and knowledge that a potential member has about the organization and their role within it.\n\n2. **Encounter (Organizational Member)**\n - This phase begins when the individual actually joins the organization. It involves the new member experiencing the reality of the organization and their role, which may differ from their initial expectations.\n\n3. **Role Management (Organizational Member)**\n - This phase involves the new member adjusting to their role within the organization, managing their responsibilities, and integrating into the organizational culture.\n\nThe diagram uses arrows to indicate the transition between these phases and highlights the shift from pre-entry to becoming an organizational member.\n\nEXHIBIT 8.2 Stages of organizational socialization. \n\nSource: Sased on Feldmen, D.C. 0 976).

This process is called version of this figure. \n\nanticipatory socialization. Some an ticipatory socialization includes a formal process of skill and attitude acquisition, such as that which might occur by attending college or university. \n\nOther anticipatory socialization might be informal, such as that acquired through a series of summer jobs or even by watching the portrayal of organizational life in television shows and movies. Some organizations begin to socialize job candidates even before they are hired at recruitment events, where organizational representatives discuss the organization with potential hires. As we shall see shortly, organizations vary in the extent to which they encourage anticipatory socialization in advance of entry. As well, not all anticipatory socialization is accurate and useful for the new member. \n\nENCOUNTER In the encounter stage, the new recruit, armed with some expectations about organizational life, encounters the day-to-day reality of this life. Formal aspects of this stage might include orientation programs and rotation through various parts of the organization. \n\nInformal aspects include getting to know and understand the style and personality of o ne's boss and co-workers. At this stage, the organization and its experienced members are looking for an acceptable degree of conformity to organizational norms and the gradual acquisition of appropriate role behaviour. Recruits, on the other hand, are interested in having their personal needs and expectations fulfilled. If successful, the recruit will have complied with critical organizational norms and should begin to identify with experienced organizational members. \n\nROLE MANAGEMENT Having survived the encounter stage and acquired basic role behaviours, the new member's attention shifts to fine tuning and actively managing his or her role in the organization. Following some conformity to group norms, the new recruit might now be in a position to modify the role to better serve the organization. This might require forming connections outside the immediate workgroup. The organizational member must also confront balancing the now-familiar organizational role with non-work roles and family demands. Each of these experiences provides additional socialization to the role occupant, who m ight begin to internalize the norms and values that are prominent in the organization. \n\nNow that we have seen a basic sketch of how socialization proceeds, let's take a closer look at some of the key issues in the process.\n\n\n# Methods Of Socialization\n- Organizations differ in terms of who does the socializing, how it is done, and *how much* is done. Most organizations make use of the following methods of socialization:\n- **Realistic job previews** - **Employee orientation programs** - **Socialization tactics** - Mentoring\n\n\n# Socia L Influence, Socialization, And Organizational Culture\n## Organizational Socialization Lo (D\nThe story of Mark, the social worker, in the previous section describes how one individual was socialized into a particular organ ization.

Organizational identification reflects an individual's learning and acceptance of an organization's culture.10 In summary, socialization is important because it has a direct effect on proximal socialization outcomes (e.g., learning, PJ fit, and PO fit), which lead to more positive distal outcomes \n(e.g., organizational identification). As we shall see, some of this process might occur before organization membership formally begins, while some of it occurs once the new member enters the organization. Furthermore, sociali zation is an o ngoing process by virtue of continuous interaction with others in the organization. However, socialization is most potent during certain periods of membership transition, such as when one is promoted or assigned to a new work group or department, and especially when one joins a new organization.11\n\n\n## Employee Orientation Programs\n## Proactive Socialization\nYou may rocall from Chapter 2 that individuals learn by observing and imitating the behaviour of others and that proactive behaviours involve taking initiative to improve current circumstances or create new ones. Thus, it should not surprise you that these forms of learning are also important for socialization. That is, newcomers can be proactive in their socialization and in the management of their careers through the use of proactive behaviours. \n\nProactive socialization refers to the process in which newcomers play an active role in their socialization th rough th e use of a number of proactive behaviours. Exhibit 8.6 describes the major types of proactive socialization behaviours. Two of the most importan t proactive behaviours are to request fmlback about one's work and job performance (feedback seeking) and to seek in formation about one's work tasks, roles, work group, and organization (information seekin g). Recall th at organizational socialization is about learning the attitudes, kn oY.i edge, and behaviours th at are necessary to function as an effective member of a group and organization. \n\nOne way for new employees to learn is to seek in formation from others in the organization.6l Newcomers can acquire information by requesting it, by asking questions, and by observing the behaviour of others. In addition, there are d ifferent sources that can be used to acquire information, such as supervisors, co-workers, mentors, and v.'Titten documents. However, research has found that newcomers rely primarily on observation, followed by interpersonal sources (i.e., supervisors and co-workers). Furthermore, they tend to seek out task-related in formation th e most, especially during the early period of socialization, followed by role, group, and organization information.\n\n6\n\n) \n\nIn addition to feedback seeking and in formation seeking, newcomers can also be proactive by participating in social events (general socializ ing), develo ping friendships and rela· \

In fact, it often continues for months after an individual has entered the organization, and in some organizations it continues throughout the entire first year. So what happens to new hires o nce the orientation program has ended? \n\nJohn Van Maanen and Edgar Schein developed a theory of socialization that helps us understand and explain the socialization process. They suggested that there are six socialization tactics that organizations can use to structure the early work experiences of new hires and individuals who are in transition from one role to another. As shown in Exhibit 8.4, each of the six tactics consists of a bipolar continuum that can be grouped into two separate patterns of socialization that are called institutionalized and individualized socialization \n(see Exhibit 8.5 for descriptions of each of the tactics).\"' \nSocializat ion tactics. \n\nThe manner in which organizations structure the earty wort< experiences of newcomers and Individuals v.tlo are in transition from one role to another. \n\n![1_image_0.png](http://storage.minio.middleware.dev.motiong.net/ta-ve-data/chatbot_testing_docs/img_736c6a6f4a402bac8e4d8a48dbc8c1b0/1_image_0.png)\nDescription for the above media: The diagram compares two types of socialization tactics: Institutionalized Socialization and Individualized Socialization. \n\n- **Institutionalized Socialization** is characterized by:\n - Collective\n - Formal\n - Sequential\n - Fixed\n - Serial\n - Investiture\n\n- **Individualized Socialization** is characterized by:\n - Individual\n - Informal\n - Random\n - Variable\n - Disjunctive\n - Divestiture\n\nThese tactics are categorized into three groups:\n- **Context Tactics**\n- **Content Tactics**\n- **Social Tactics**\n\nThe diagram visually contrasts the structured, uniform approach of institutionalized socialization with the more flexible, personalized approach of individualized socialization.\n\nCallecthe-111 Ia6ldml Tlldla When using the ClODedive tactic, a number of new members are IOCialized as a group, going through the aame apaienca and facing the aame c:ballenees- Anny boot camps, fiatemity pleclae classes, and training dasaa filr salespeople and flight attendanb are common exampla.

Having been humbled and stripped of preconceptions, members are then ready to learn the norms of the organizatio n. An extreme example is the rough treatment and shaved heads of U.S. Marine Corps recruits. Sometimes organizations prefer not to use debasement or hazing as part of the socialization of newcomers.

Other military personnel are visible in the background, also receiving vaccinations. The setting appears to be a medical facility or a designated area for administering vaccines.\n\nSome socialization tactics, such as debasement and hazing, are designed to strip new members of their old beliefs, values, and attitudes and get them to internalize new ones. \n\nWhy would an organization choose institutionalized over individualized socialization? \n\nInstitutionalized socialization tactics are effective in promoting organizational loyalty and uniformity of behaviour among those being socialized. This last characteristic is often very important. No matter where they are in the world, soldiers know whom to salute and how to do it. Similarly, air passengers need not expect any surprises from cabin crew, thanks to the flight attendants' institutionalized socialization. \n\n\\<\\'hen socialization is individualized, new members are more likely to take on the particular characteristics and style of those who are socializing them. Thus, two newly hired real estate agents who receive on-the-job training from their bosses might soon think and act more like their bosses than like each other. As you can see, uniformity is less likely under individualized socialization. \n\nInstitutionalized socialization is always followed up by some individualized socialization as the member joins his or her regular work unit. For example, rookie police officers are routinely partnered with more experienced offiurs. At this point, they will begin to develop some individuality in the style with which they perform their jobs.\n\n\n# Socialization Tactics: Research Evidence\n- *Institutionalization* socialization tactics have been found to be related to proximal and distal outcomes:\n- Lower role ambiguity and role conflict - More positive PJ and PO fit perceptions - More positive job satisfaction and organizational commitment - Lower stress and turnover - A more custodial role orientation\n- *Individualized* socialization tactics result in a more innovative role orientation in which new recruits might change or modify the way they perform their tasks and roles.\n\n- The *social* tactics (serial-disjunctive and investiture-divestiture) have been found to be the most strongly related to socialization outcomes.\n\n\n## Diagnosing A Culture\n## Scoring And Interpretation\nThis scale measures the six socialization tactics. To calculate your scores on each tactic, you first must subtract your response to questions 3, 9, 15, 17, 19, 20, 27, 29, and 39 from 6. For example, if you gave a response of 5 to question 3, give yourself a l \n(6 minus 5). Then calculate your score for each socialization tactic by adding up your answers as follows: \nCollective versus individual tactic: Add your answers to questions 1, 7, 13, 19, and 25. \n\nFormal versus informal tactic: Add your answers to questions 2, 8, 14, 20, and 26. \n\nInvestiture versus divestiture tactic: Add your answers to questions 3, 9, 15, 21, and 27. \n\nSequential versus random tactic.: Add your answers to questions 4, 10, 16, 22, and 28. \n\nSerial versus disjunctive tactic: Add your answers to questions 5, 11, 17, 23, and 29.\n\n\n# Socialization Tactics\n- *Institutionalization* socialization tactics are effective in promoting organizational loyalty and uniformity of behaviour.\n\n- When socialization is *individualized*, new members are more likely to take on the particular characteristics and style of those who are socializing them.\n\n- Institutionalized socialization is always followed up by some individualized socialization as the member joins his or her regular work unit.\n\n\n## Diagnosing A Culture\n## Fixed Versus Variable Tactic.; Add Your Answers To\nquestions 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30. \n\nFor each scale your total score should be somewhere between 5 and 25. Higher scores reflect the institutionalized end of the scale ( collective, formal, investiture, sequential, serial, and fixed). You can calculate a total score for all tactics by adding your responses to all 30 questions. Your total scale should fall between 30 and 150. Higher scores reflect a preference for institutionalized socialization. To calculate your socialization experience scores, follow the same procedures but this time use your answers from Part 2. \n\nTo compare your socialization preferences to your socialization experience, calculate a socialization preference difference score by subtracting your socialization experience score from your socialization preference score for each tactic. For example, if your collective-individual socialization preference score was 25 and your socialization experience score was 10, the difference would be 15. A small difference indicates greater congruence between your socialization preference and experience. Large differences indicate a discrepancy between how you prefer to be socializt.-d and the way you were socialized. \n\nTo facilitate class discussion and your understanding of socialization tactics, form a small group with several other members of the class and consider the following questions: \nI. Each group member should present their preference score of each socialization tactic. What is the average of the group for each tactic? For each of the six tactics, do most group members prefer the institutionalized or individualized tactic? \n\nEach group member should explain their preference for each tactic. \n\n2. Each group membt-r should present their experience score of each socialization tactic. What is the average of the group for each tactic? For each of the six tactics, did most group members experience institutionalized or individualized socialization? \n\nEach group member should explain how they were socialized and what effect it had on them. \n\n3. Each group member should present their socialization preference-experience difference score for each tactic. What are largest and smallest differences and for which tactics?

Despite having inherited a very successful company, Welch had proceeded to change the fundamental culture of GE from a vast bureaucracy to an agile, fast-paced company that was remarkably innovative for its size. Central to the changes that Welch had implemented at GE was the idea of \"Work-out!\" which meant, quite literally, driving low-value-added bureaucratic work out of the organization, thereby speeding up the way things were done and creating a culture of change, innovation, self-confidence and engagement among GE \nemployees. \n\nAs Welch had described it, it was a multi-year initiative rather than a quick fix. It had requ.ired a huge commitment of time and money, over many years, as he sought a permanent culture change rather than just a series of \"improvement events.\" \nWork-Out! had laid the basis for the subsequent introduction of Six Sigma at GE. By getting rid of the low-value-added processes, GE was able to focus on improving the processes that were important, which laid the groundwork for productivity improvements that continued long after Welch had retired from GE. Speeding up processes had also reduced working capital, money that had subsequently b<:en used as part of GE's acquisition strategy through the 1980s and 1990s. \n\nOne of Welch's pieces of advice to other business leaders was to \"Plagiarize with Pride\"-copy other successful initiatives. And that was just what Bradshaw had done. Just over a year ago, he had raist.-d the issue of doing something quite dramatic with his executive team. His proposal was that the company would start a series of workshops modelled on the GE Work-Out! Process, and they comm it to continue to run these, following up on the recommendations, for at least three years. Every single employee in the company would be given the oppor-tunity to participate in one or more of these events. \n\nThe entire overhauling process would be accompa-nied by a fundamental redefinition of the roles of managers, different measurement systems would be put into place that were aligned with a changed culture, and it would be made clear to all managers that establishing and maintaining an engaged work-**force would be considered as important as achiev-**ing financial goals. Most importantly, these changes would be made by the people who would be affected by them. Individual employees would be involved in identifying the need for change as well as recom-**mending the specific actions to be taken, and these** \nsame people would be involved in driving the proposed changes through to completion. \n\nBradshav/s views about the roles of manag-ers and employees were simple; he believed that the vast majority of employees wanted to do a good job, wanted to add value of the company, wanted to please customers . . . **and so on. The role of managers was** \nto enable this to happen. They should act as train-**ers, coaches, problem solvers, process enablers, and** \nresource acquirers rather than as overseers or bosses in the traditional sense. \n\nThe reaction from Bradshaw's managements te."}

In fact, it often continues for months after an individual has entered the organization, and in some organizations it continues throughout the entire first year. So what happens to new hires o nce the orientation program has ended? \n\nJohn Van Maanen and Edgar Schein developed a theory of socialization that helps us understand and explain the socialization process. They suggested that there are six socialization tactics that organizations can use to structure the early work experiences of new hires and individuals who are in transition from one role to another. As shown in Exhibit 8.4, each of the six tactics consists of a bipolar continuum that can be grouped into two separate patterns of socialization that are called institutionalized and individualized socialization \n(see Exhibit 8.5 for descriptions of each of the tactics).\"' \nSocializat ion tactics. \n\nThe manner in which organizations structure the earty wort< experiences of newcomers and Individuals v.tlo are in transition from one role to another. \n\n![1_image_0.png](http://storage.minio.middleware.dev.motiong.net/ta-ve-data/chatbot_testing_docs/img_736c6a6f4a402bac8e4d8a48dbc8c1b0/1_image_0.png)\nDescription for the above media: The diagram compares two types of socialization tactics: Institutionalized Socialization and Individualized Socialization. \n\n- **Institutionalized Socialization** is characterized by:\n - Collective\n - Formal\n - Sequential\n - Fixed\n - Serial\n - Investiture\n\n- **Individualized Socialization** is characterized by:\n - Individual\n - Informal\n - Random\n - Variable\n - Disjunctive\n - Divestiture\n\nThese tactics are categorized into three groups:\n- **Context Tactics**\n- **Content Tactics**\n- **Social Tactics**\n\nThe diagram visually contrasts the structured, uniform approach of institutionalized socialization with the more flexible, personalized approach of individualized socialization.\n\nCallecthe-111 Ia6ldml Tlldla When using the ClODedive tactic, a number of new members are IOCialized as a group, going through the aame apaienca and facing the aame c:ballenees- Anny boot camps, fiatemity pleclae classes, and training dasaa filr salespeople and flight attendanb are common exampla.

Institutionalized socialization tactics have been found to be related to proximal outcomes, such as lower role ambiguity and conflict and more positive perceptions of PJ and PO fit. as well as distal outcomes, such as more positive job satisfaction and organizational commitment and lower stress and turnover. In addition, the institutionalized socialization tactics result in a more custodial role orientation, in which new hires accept the status quo and the requirements of their tasks and roles. On the other hand, the individualized socialization tactics result in a more innovative role orientation, in which new recruits might change or modify the way they perform their tasks and roles. \n\nIt is also worth noting that among the different socialization tactics, the social tactics \n(serial-disjunctive and investiture-divestiture) have been found to be the most strongly related to socialization outcomes. This is consistent with research that has found that organizations that are more successful at socializing newcomers help them to establish a broad network of relationships with co-workers.' 11 Furthermore, as describt.-d in the Ethical Focus: \nSocialization Tactics and Ethical Conflict, divestiture socialization tactics can also result in ethical conflict at work. \n\n274\n\n\n## Diagnosing A Culture\n## Fixed Versus Variable Tactic.; Add Your Answers To\nquestions 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30. \n\nFor each scale your total score should be somewhere between 5 and 25.

Most organizations make use of the following methods of socialization:\n- **Realistic job previews** - **Employee orientation programs** - **Socialization tactics** - Mentoring\n\n\n## Diagnosing A Culture\n## Scoring And Interpretation\nThis scale measures the six socialization tactics. To calculate your scores on each tactic, you first must subtract your response to questions 3, 9, 15, 17, 19, 20, 27, 29, and 39 from 6.

This is in part ov.'ing to the fact that some organizations make use of other organizations to help socialize their members. For example, hospitals do not develop experienced cardiologists from scratch. \n\nRather, they depend on medical schools to socialize potential doctors in the basic role requirements of being a physician. Similarly, business firms rely on business schools to send them recruits who think and act in a business-like manner. In this way, a fair degree of anticipatory socialization may exist before a person joins an organization. On the other hand, organizations such as police forces, the military, and religious institutions are less likely to rely on external socialization. Police academies, boot camps, and seminaries are set up as extensions of these organizations to aid in socialization. \n\nOrganizations that handle their own socialization are especially interested in maintaining the continuity and stability of job behaviours over a period of time. Conversely, those that rely o n external agencies to perform anticipatory socialization are oriented toward maintaining the potential for creative, innovative behaviour o n the part of members-there is *less* \n\"inbreeding.\" Of course, reliance on external agents m ight present problems. The engineer who is socialized in university courses to respect design elegance might find it d ifficult to accept cost restrictions when he or she is employed by an engineering firm. For this reason, organizations that rely heavily on external socialization always supplement it with formal training and orientation or informal on-the-job training. \n\nThe point is that organizations differ in terms of *who* does the socializing, *how* it is done, and *how much* is done. Most organizations, however, make use of a number of methods of socialization, including realistic job previews, employee orientation programs, socialization tactics, and mentoring. Let's now take a closer look at each of these methods of organizational socialization.\n\n\n# Socialization Steps In Strong Cultures\n![39_image_0.png](http://storage.minio.middleware.dev.motiong.net/ta-ve-data/chatbot_testing_docs/img_88197b6b713605b1fd5ed930fa72acaf/39_image_0.png)\nDescription for the above media: The diagram illustrates a process flow for organizational development and employee integration.
